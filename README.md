# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset with a primary focus on **passenger survival analysis**. The goal is to understand how different features influenced survival probability by exploring patterns, relationships, and trends in the data.

The analysis includes **univariate analysis**, **bivariate analysis**, and **feature engineering** across all relevant features to derive meaningful insights.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Univariate analysis of individual features
- Bivariate analysis with respect to survival
- Feature engineering to create meaningful variables
- Comparative survival rate analysis across multiple features
- Data visualization for better interpretation of insights

---

## 🧠 Key Features Analyzed
- Passenger Class
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- Family Size
- Embarkation Port
- Engineered features such as:
  - FamilySize
  - FamilyType
  - P_Title
  - Individual_Fare

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Gender played a major role in survival probability
- Higher passenger classes had better survival rates
- Passengers traveling with family showed distinct survival patterns
- Age and fare revealed non-linear relationships with survival

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset is taken from the **Kaggle**.

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Feature selection and correlation analysis
- Applying machine learning models for survival prediction
- Model evaluation and performance comparison
